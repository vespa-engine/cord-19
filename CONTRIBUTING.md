## Running frontend locally
To work on the frontend application, it is easiest to run a version of the frontend
locally on your machine to test your changes before submitting a PR. 
1. Clone this repo to your local work directory.
1. Install and start [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) if you haven't already.
1. Download and start an instance needed to run the front-end: \
`$ docker run -ti --rm --name cord-19 -p 3000:3000 --entrypoint /bin/sh -v /PATH/TO/WORKDIR/cord-19:/app -w /app node:12-alpine`
1. Inside the container, install the dependencies: \
`/app # yarn install`
1. Now start the frontend server: \
`/app # yarn start`

Your local copy of the frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000/.
