# CORD-19 Search

This is the __frontend__ of the [Vespa CORD-19 Search](https://cord19.vespa.ai/).
The __backend__ [Vespa](https://vespa.ai) application is 
[here](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/vespa-cloud/cord-19-search). 
All of this is open source.

For more advanced usage, see the [CORD-19 API](/cord-19-queries.md).

This application serves data from _COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). 2020. Version 2020-04-10._
_Retrieved from https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research._
_Accessed 2020-04-04. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3727291_

It is made accessible by the Vespa Team.
[Vespa](https://vespa.ai) is an open source big data serving engine:
store, search, rank and organize big data at user serving time.

To implement this application, we also used:
